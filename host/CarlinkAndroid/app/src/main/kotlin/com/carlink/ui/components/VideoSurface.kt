/**
 * Compose wrapper for VideoSurfaceView. Uses HWC overlay for low-latency rendering.
 *
 * See VideoSurfaceView.kt for the underlying SurfaceHolder.Callback deferred-fire state
 * machine (pending-surface bookkeeping, idempotent teardown, re-create semantics).
 *
 * CALLER CONTRACT (load-bearing — the factory block below runs exactly once):
 *  - onSurfaceAvailable / onSurfaceDestroyed / onSurfaceSizeChanged / onTouchEvent are
 *    captured by the Callback object on first composition. There is no update={} block
 *    and no rememberUpdatedState indirection, so non-stable lambdas passed on later
 *    recompositions are SILENTLY IGNORED. Callers MUST hoist these lambdas with
 *    remember {} (or rememberUpdatedState via an outer wrapper) to avoid stale captures.
 *  - onSurfaceDestroyed is invoked from TWO sources: (a) DisposableEffect.onDispose when
 *    the composable leaves the tree, and (b) VideoSurfaceView.Callback.onSurfaceDestroyed
 *    when the underlying SurfaceHolder tears down. Both can fire for a single teardown.
 *    CarlinkManager.onSurfaceDestroyed (CarlinkManager.kt:1124) handles this idempotently —
 *    it null-checks videoSurface, cancels any pending debounce job, and retires the video
 *    epoch through a monitor-guarded null-swap, so a second call is a no-op. Do not add
 *    de-dup here — the downstream handler is the source of truth.

/**
 * Optional externally-driven state holder for a [VideoSurface].
 *
 * NOT automatically wired: the [VideoSurface] composable does NOT accept a state holder
 * parameter. Callers create an instance via [rememberVideoSurfaceState] and MUST manually
 * wire it by passing its methods as the composable's lambda params, e.g.:
 *   val state = rememberVideoSurfaceState()
 *   VideoSurface(
 *       onSurfaceAvailable = state::onSurfaceAvailable,
 *       onSurfaceDestroyed = state::onSurfaceDestroyed,
 *       onSurfaceSizeChanged = state::onSurfaceSizeChanged,
 *   )
 *
 * Live usage: MainScreen.kt:86. Reads like orphaned API but is intentionally decoupled —
 * callers that don't need observable surface state can ignore it entirely.
 *
 * WIRING REQUIREMENT: if you wire [onSurfaceAvailable] but leave [onSurfaceSizeChanged]
 * null on the composable, [width]/[height] here will stay at their creation values
 * (see VideoSurface's onSurfaceChanged silent-drop note).
