/**
 * SurfaceView for H.264 decoding via HWC overlay (lower latency than TextureView).
 * Forwards Surface lifecycle and touch events to a [Callback].
 *
 * Threading: SurfaceHolder.Callback is delivered on the main thread (Android contract).
 * The [callback] property is a plain mutable var with no @Volatile/synchronization;
 * reads from other threads may see stale values, and reassigning mid-lifecycle can
 * produce orphaned create-without-destroy (or destroy-without-create) pairs for
 * the replaced consumer. Assign [callback] from the main thread only, ideally before
 * the surface is attached to the window.
