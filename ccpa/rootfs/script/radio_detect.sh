# radio_detect.sh - resolve THIS unit's WLAN/BT platform, read-only, and write a sourceable
# descriptor to /tmp/radio_caps. Run at boot before anything wants a radio, and again after a
# driver load (the post-load facts are the ones nobody can predict).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. CCPA ships at least six WLAN/BT parts (RTL8822BS/CS, RTL8733BS, BCM4354/4335,
# BCM4358, NXP SD8987, NXP IW416) and - per the resources repo's
# 01_Firmware_Architecture/device_variants_and_conversion.md - ONLY the driver tarball for a
# unit's own chip ships in its rootfs. There is no fallback set. So every layer above this one
# has to stop hardcoding one chip's names and paths, and instead ask.
#
# THE RULE THIS SCRIPT OBEYS (same as tools/ncm_base_install.sh): never branch on a chipset
# whitelist for BEHAVIOUR - an unlisted variant falls off the end of one and gets nothing. The
# chip-name table below is for HUMANS and logs only; nothing acts on it. Behaviour is derived
# from what the unit itself carries:
#
#   the SDIO id          - hardware ground truth, readable before any driver loads
#   /lib/firmware/<tree> - exactly one tree per unit, so the tree names the vendor
#   the attach helper    - rtk_hciattach XOR brcm_patchram_plus XOR hciattach+fw_loader_linux
#   /script/init_bluetooth_wifi.sh - the VENDOR's own per-SDIO-id dispatcher, which every unit
#                          ships and which knows that unit's exact insmod/attach lines
#
# The vendor dispatcher is the authority for the bottom half (load the driver, attach the
# controller) precisely because it encodes per-chip knowledge we cannot re-derive - e.g. on
# 0xc822 and SD8987 the BT attach must wait for wlan0 or the chip wedges. We own everything
# ABOVE the driver; see radio_hal.sh for why delegating the vendor's AP/network half is not
# merely inadequate but destructive on a stripped box.
#
# DO NOT make this script mutate anything. It must be safe to run at any time, in any state,
# including from a diagnostic shell mid-session. Loading a driver to "find out" is exactly the
# side effect callers rely on not happening.

# Resolution order, and the reason for it:
#   owned  - this unit got the project's own scripts (the IW416 baseline). Proven, keep using.
#   vendor - the unit's factory dispatcher survived the strip (ncm_base_install.sh's is_radio()
#            guard protects it by explicit basename). It is the only on-unit-correct source for
#            five of the six variants.
#   none   - no path. Report it loudly; wireless is unavailable. WIRED projection is unaffected,
#            it never touches a radio.

# load_bluetooth_wifi.sh is deliberately NOT accepted as a dispatcher: despite the generic name

# ---- 4b. ADOPT THE VENDOR'S MAPPING, NOT THEIR MECHANISM -----------------------------------
# BACKEND=mapped means: this unit's own dispatcher is the authority for WHAT to run, and we
# extract those command lines here. It does NOT mean we execute the dispatcher. Running it
# wholesale would re-import the very defects the owned scripts exist to fix:
#   - it forks BT attach and returns (`/script/attach_bluetooth.sh &`), which is exactly the
#     uncoordinated double-bring-up docs/wireless/01_BT_AND_RADIO.md recorded fighting itself for 7+ minutes;
#   - the Broadcom branches background brcm_patchram_plus the same way;
#   - the SD8987 branch can `reboot` the box from inside a radio bring-up, bypassing the
#     supervisor's reboot budget;
#   - it untars overlays into `/` and its BT health check is object-existence, which a dead
#     chip passes (docs/wireless/01_BT_AND_RADIO.md again).
# The per-chip command lines are the vendor's OBSERVATIONS - fleet-deployed and working - so we
# take them verbatim. The surrounding control flow is their CHOICE, and we do not.
#
# The extraction carries no chipset table: we intersect the modules in THIS unit's own tarball
# with the dispatcher's own insmod lines. A part nobody anticipated still resolves, because the
# unit ships a dispatcher that knows its own silicon and a tarball that names its own modules.
# REFUSE TO EMIT WHAT WE CANNOT FAITHFULLY EXECUTE. Single-line extraction only works while a
# vendor branch is closed-form. The Realtek branches are; the NXP and Broadcom ones are NOT -
# they carry shell variables resolved elsewhere in the dispatcher:
#     insmod /tmp/moal.ko "mod_para=$nxpWiFiConfig"
#     brcm_patchram_plus --patchram /lib/firmware/bcm/$bcmBTFirmware ... --bd_addr "$bcmBTMac" &
# Captured verbatim, those are not commands, they are text that happens to look like one. Worse,
# writing them into the descriptor makes `. /tmp/radio_caps` abort under `set -u` - status 2,
# which radio_hal defines as "already converged". A mapping we cannot execute must therefore
# become NO mapping, so the seam reports "unsupported" honestly and the caller can act on it.
# A trailing `&` is stripped rather than rejected: backgrounding is the vendor's control-flow
# choice, and radio_hal supplies its own detached-and-converged discipline in its place.
